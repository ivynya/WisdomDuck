    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>We remind you that the duck will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.</p>
    <p>Personally-identifiable info is not collected on this site. The duck increments a simple counter so we can see how many people like wisdom. Skeptical? The duck is open source! <a href="https://github.com/SDBagel/WisdomDuck">Absorb the open source wisdom here.</a></p>
    <p>This project uses <a href="https://twemoji.twitter.com">the twemoji duck</a>.</p>
    <h2>Wisdom API</h2>
    <p>Did you know wisdom duck has an API? It's this really cool thing that allows you to integrate wisdom into any apps you develop. Call <a href="/api/wisdom/dispense">/api/wisdom/dispense</a> to get a plaintext string with your wisdom. It couldn't be simpler!</p>
